0.1.3
	Abstracted the transport mechanism by creating SOAPTransport
	class and SOAPonHTTP class.  It should be trivial (easier) to
	implement your own transport and add new ones.
	Did some header cleanup.
	Removed the funky operator() from SOAPProxy.  It was an
	experiment.  I didn't like it.
	Improved the HTTPProtocol to be more robust with dropped
	connections.
	Added interopability tests for Apache, SOAP::Lite.

0.1.2, aka Groundhog
	Fixed SSL, wasn't handling SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE return codes.
	Compiles cleanly with -Wall.
	Fixed bug with error message for XML_Parse.
	Converted all sprintf's to snprintf's.
	Exceptions use printf() style for formatted messages.
	A newline was added to the end of all header files.
	XML is escaped properly now.
	Added buffering to SOAPProtocolBase.
	Turned TCP_NODELAY on in SOAPClientSocket.
	Fixed User-Agent.
	Use streams in tests.cpp.

0.1.1, aka Burnt Chicken
	A bit of cleanup to make it easier to compile.
	Compiles on Linux.

0.1
