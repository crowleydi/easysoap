0.6, 27-Mar-2002
	Tons of stuff.  bug fixes, namespaces, bug fixes, changed header
	file location.  Tons of stuff.  TONS of stuff.  Still no documentation.

0.5
	I forgot.  Too long ago.

0.4, aka WROX
	Added SOAPHTTPServer.   Bertrand nudged me at the right time.
	Moved build system to autoconf/automake.  Thanks to Mike Anothony.
	Switched keep-alive back to being default.
	This release was pushed out for the WROX book.

0.3, 21-Jun-2001
	Mostly a bug fix release.
	Default schema is now 2001.
	HTTP bug fixes + robustness improvements.
	Array parsing cleanup and fixes.
	More error checking on double and float conversion.
	Enchanced logging for debugging purposes.
	Added initial support for handling wide characters (Assumes
	wide char strings are UTF-16 or UTF-32, at least I think thats
	what it's doing...)

0.2, aka Infomercial 17-Apr-2001
	Major changes.
	Extensible type system.
	Lots of changes and bug fixes for interop testing.
	Initial support to run as a CGI server.
	Servers for SOAPBuilders interop and Userland validator.

0.1.4, aka Foot and Mouth 23-Mar-2001
	No real new features.  Added some stuff for configuring on
	a per compiler basis.  I don't like it.  I really need to
	do autoconf.  Now compiles on Cygwin32, MS VC++, Linux, FreeBSD
	Sun Solaris 5.8 (gcc), Compaq Tru64 (gcc), and maybe Codewarrior.
	
0.1.3, aka Roadkill 5-Feb-2001
	Abstracted the transport mechanism by creating SOAPTransport
	class and SOAPonHTTP class.  It should be trivial (easier) to
	implement your own transport and add new ones.
	Did some header cleanup.
	Removed the funky operator() from SOAPProxy.  It was an
	experiment.  I didn't like it.
	Improved the HTTPProtocol to be more robust with dropped
	connections.
	Added interopability tests for Apache, SOAP::Lite.
