Release 0.8
=====================================

1) Lots of bug fixes over the years since the last release.  These fixes
   were in CVS but never released.  Now they are.
2) Compiles against gcc 4.1.1 and Visual C++ 8.0/Visual Studio 2005.
3) Needs Expat XML at least 1.95.7 or higher but recommend 2.0.0.
4) Probably the last release unless somebody wants to take the reins.


Release 0.6
=====================================

The Expat XML parsing library 1.95.2 is required.  You can download it
from expat.sourceforge.net. See below.

Major changes in this release:

1)  Header files are now in a sub-directory called "easysoap" so
	you will need to change any includes from, for example:

	#include <SOAP.h>

	to:

	#include <easysoap/SOAP.h>

2)  All classes are now in the namespace "EasySoap" for compilers
	which support namespaces.  There are some macros available to
	help make this transparent.

	USING_EASYSOAP_NAMESPACE
	BEGIN_EASYSOAP_NAMESPACE
	END_EASYSOAP_NAMESPACE

	Your SOAPTypeTraits classes will have to be defined within the
	EasySoap namespace.

3)  I have temporarily disabled the SOAPHTTPServer class because
	I was getting way too many bug reports on the underlying Abyss
	library which it uses.  Sorry.  I added that class mostly as
	a demonstration of how to write a transport with existing HTTP
	servers, not as a production server, and also to have a simple
	HTTP server out of the box.  But its existence is causing me too
	many headaches (I take things too personally, I like code that
	works and hate hearing about it when it doesn't, and really hate
	fixing code I didn't write) and we need a better solution. 
	An Apache module transport is the way to go, and it is in the
	works.  Any help on it would be GREATLY appreciated.  If youd
	insist on using the Abyss HTTP server, feel free.  You will have
	to figure out on your own how to compile it and any bug reports
	on it will be merrily :) ignored. 

4)	Blaise added client SSL client certificate support for platforms
	which use OpenSSL.  I changed the default client transport on
	Win32 platforms to use the WinInet functions so on those platforms
	all kinds of cool stuff comes for free (client certificates, SSL,
	etc.)

Numerous people (Scott Deerwester, Haitao Song, Patrick McConnell,
I've missed many, apologies) have sent me great feedback and have
helped me catch and fix many bugs.  I really appreciate the bug reports
and the positive feedback I have received.  I also appreciate all
the help Blaise has put in for this release.  Thanks to all of
you!

HOW TO BUILD EASYSOAP
=====================================

1) Install Expat (see below)
2) Install OpenSSL (optional)
3) If you're on Linux/Unix:
	./configure
	make
	make install

   If you're on Windows, VC6:
	Load easysoap.dsw.  Build All.

   Cygwin
	./configure --disable-shared (see below)
	make
	make install


HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND BUILD EXPAT
=====================================


For Linux :
	Download source from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	
	tar xzf expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	cd expat-1.95.2
	./configure
	make
	make install (must be root to install into /usr/local)


For Win32 :
	Dowload the install binary from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat_win32bin_1_95_2.exe
	Run the program.  The EasySoap++ project file is set up to look
	for Expat in a directory parallel to EasySoap++-0.5.  So if you
	unpacked EasySoap++-0.5 into C:\code\EasySoap++-0.5 then install
	Expat into C:\code\Expat-1.95.2.  Otherwise you will have to modify
	the project settings to find the necessary include files.

	Before running any of the example programs, you will need to make sure
	that the file Expat.DLL is in your PATH.  You can do this in any
	several ways:

	1)  Copy Expat.DLL to the EasySoap++-0.5\win32\Release directory
		(or Debug directory).
	2)  Change your PATH environment variable to include the
		Expat-1.95.2\libs directory.  The easiest way to do this is
		to go to right click on "My Computer/Properties," select the
		"Advacned" tab, then press the "Environment Variables..." button.
		In there edit the value for PATH.

For Cygwin:
	I had trouble getting 1.95.2 to link properly with Cygwin.  I had to
	make a small change to expat.h.in.  Take a look here for details:

		http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=454879&group_id=10127&atid=110127

	Also, I wasn't able to build a shared library with Cygwin.  If you
	figure it out, let me know.
