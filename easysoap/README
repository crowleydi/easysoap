Release. 0.5
=====================================

The Expat XML parsing library 1.95.2 is required.  You can download it
from expat.sourceforge.net. See below.

To run the tests program you will need to install  SOAP::Lite.
The soap.daemon must be running on localhost. You may have to edit
soap.daemon so you can access the example SOAP classes in /My/Examples.
On linux, I had to install the ActiveState 5.6 perl distribution from
www.activestate.com.

Please submit bug reports and comments to:
dcrowley@users.sourceforge.net.


HOW TO BUILD EASYSOAP
=====================================

1) Install Expat (see below)
2) Install OpenSSL (optional)
3) If you're on Linux/Unix:
	./configure
	make
	make install

   If you're on Windows, VC6:
	Load easysoap.dsw.  Build All.

   Cygwin
	./configure --disable-shared (see below)
	make
	make install

HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND BUILD EXPAT
=====================================


For Linux :
	Download source from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	
	tar xzf expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	cd expat-1.95.2
	./configure
	make
	make install (must be root to install into /usr/local)


For Win32 :
	Dowload the install binary from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat_win32bin_1_95_2.exe
	Run the program.  The EasySoap++ project file is set up to look
	for Expat in a directory parallel to EasySoap++-0.5.  So if you
	unpacked EasySoap++-0.5 into C:\code\EasySoap++-0.5 then install
	Expat into C:\code\Expat-1.95.2.  Otherwise you will have to modify
	the project settings to find the necessary include files.

	Before running any of the example programs, you will need to make sure
	that the file Expat.DLL is in your PATH.  You can do this in any
	several ways:

	1)  Copy Expat.DLL to the EasySoap++-0.5\win32\Release directory
		(or Debug directory).
	2)  Change your PATH environment variable to include the
		Expat-1.95.2\libs directory.  The easiest way to do this is
		to go to right click on "My Computer/Properties," select the
		"Advacned" tab, then press the "Environment Variables..." button.
		In there edit the value for PATH.

For Cygwin:
	I had trouble getting 1.95.2 to link properly with Cygwin.  I had to
	make a small change to expat.h.in.  Take a look here for details:

		http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=454879&group_id=10127&atid=110127

	Also, I wasn't able to build a shared library with Cygwin.  If you
	figure it out, let me know.
