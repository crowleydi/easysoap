Alpha release. 0.4
=====================================

The Expat XML parsing library 1.95.2 is required.  You can download it
from expat.sourceforge.net. See below.

To run the tests program you will need to install  SOAP::Lite.
The soap.daemon must be running on localhost. You may have to edit
soap.daemon so you can access the example SOAP classes in /My/Examples.
On linux, I had to install the ActiveState 5.6 perl distribution from
www.activestate.com.

Please submit bug reports and comments to:
dcrowley@users.sourceforge.net.


HOW TO BUILD EASYSOAP
=====================================

1) Install Expat (see below)
2) Install OpenSSL (optional)
2) If you're on Linux/Unix:
	./configure
	make
	make install

3) If you're on Windows, VC6:
	Load easysoap.dsw.  Build All.


HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND BUILD EXPAT
=====================================


For Linux :
	Download source from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	
	tar xzf expat-1.95.2.tar.gz
	cd expat-1.95.2
	./configure
	make
	make install (must be root to install into /usr/local)


For Win32 :
	Dowload the install binary from:
		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat_win32bin_1_95_2.exe
	Run the program.  The EasySoap++ project file is set up to look
	for Expat in a directory parallel to EasySoap++-0.4.  So if you
	unpacked EasySoap++-0.4 into C:\code\EasySoap++-0.4 then install
	Expat into C:\code\Expat-1.95.2.  Otherwise you will have to modify
	the project settings to find the necessary include files.
