Alpha release. 0.4
=====================================

The Expat XML parsing library 1.95.1 is required.  You can download it
from expat.sourceforge.net. See below.

To run the tests program you will need to install  SOAP::Lite.
The soap.daemon must be running on localhost. You may have to edit
soap.daemon so you can access the example SOAP classes in /My/Examples.
On linux, I had to install the ActiveState 5.6 perl distribution from
www.activestate.com.

Please submit bug reports and comments to:
dcrowley@users.sourceforge.net.


HOW TO BUILD EASYSOAP
=====================================

1) Install Expat (see below)
2) Install OpenSSL (optional)
2) If you're on Linux/Unix:
	./configure
	make
	make install

3) If you're on Windows, VC6:
	Load easysoap.dsw.  Build All.


HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND BUILD EXPAT
=====================================

Download and untar source from:
	http://download.sourceforge.net/expat/expat-1.95.1.tar.gz

For Linux :
	cd expat
	./configure
	(SEE NOTE BELOW FOR GCC USERS)
	make
	make install (must be root to install into /usr/local)


For Win32 :
	DO NOT bother downloading the Win32 binaries for expat-1.95.1.
	The ".lib" file is missing from the binary distribution so
	You will not be able to link against it.  You will have to
	build from source...

	Using MSVC++ 6:
	Load the .dsp (File/Open.  Select "Projects(.dsp)", double click on
	expat-1.95.1/lib/expat.dsp)
	Hit F7 to start the build.
	Copy Debug/expat.lib to easysoap/win32/Debug
	Copy Debug/expat.dll to easysoap/win32/Debug

	The Debug build should compile out of the box.  The Release build
	has some problems...

	1) Turn off precompiled headers - Go to Project/Settings.  Select
	the "expat" project and make sure that "Settings For" is set to
	"Win32 Release."  Select the "C/C++" tab.  Select category
	"Precompiled Headers."  Select "Not using precompiled headers."

	2) Remove compile rule for 2 files - Select the "+" to expand the
	expat project.  Select the "+" to expand "Source files."  Select
	"xmltok_impl.c"  Select the "General" tab.  Click "Exclude file
	from build."  Repeat for "xmltok_ns.c"

	3)  VERSION define macro is wrong for xmplarse.c - select the
	"xmlrole.c" file.  Click on the C/C++ tab.  Select the
	"Preprocessor category"  select the entire value for
	"Preprocessor definitions.'  Press ctrl-c (copy).  Select the
	xmlparse.c file, select entire "Preprocessor definitions."
	Press ctrl-v (paste).  Hit "OK."

	Now it should compile.  I'm quite sure all of this is fixed in
	the expat CVS repository and thus will be fixed in the expat
	2.0 release....


COMPLILING EXPAT WITH GCC
=========================

Because EasySoap++ uses exceptions, the Expat library must be compiled
to handle exceptions correctly or crashes will occur when a C++ exception
is thrown.  After you run the configure command you must edit lib/Makefile
and add the flag "-fexceptions" to the CFLAGS proeprty.
