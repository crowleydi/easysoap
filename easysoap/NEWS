Release 0.5  05-Sep-2001
==========================

1)  I made a change to the way serialization of objects work.  Instead
	of specializing operator<<(SOAPParameter&,const MyType&) and
	operator>>(const SOAPParameter&, MyType&) you should specialize the
	templated class SOAPTypeTraits<MyType>.  The old way should still
	work but you need to use the new class so arrays of your objects
	will serialize properly.  Look in SOAPTypeTraits.h for examples.

2)  I added some support for the STL classes string, map, vector.  Just
	#include <SOAPSTL.h> and you should be good to go (except maps,
	read below.)

3)  I added some initial support for Map type classes (my SOAPHashMap and
	STL map).  How this type is serialized isn't part of the SOAP spec or
	part of the XML Schema specification but I have tested it against
	SOAP::Lite maps and it appears to work fine.  It should also work with
	Apache's Map serialization but I have not tested that...

	Before you can serialize your map class though, you need to specialize
	SOAPTypeTraits for your map class.  Example for SOAPHashMap:

		class SOAPTypeTraits< SOAPHashMap<SOAPString, int> >
			: public SOAPMapTypeTraits { };

	Example for an STL map:

		class SOAPTypeTraits< std::map<std::string, int> >
			: public SOAPSTLMapTypeTraits { };

4)  Tony Hong wrote a chapter in the upcoming WROX book "Professional XML
	Web Services" which he discusses EasySoap++.  It should be published
	and in your local bookstore sometime this month (Sept. 2001) or you
	can buy it from Amazon:
