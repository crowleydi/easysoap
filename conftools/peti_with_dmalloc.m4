dnl @synopsis PETI_WITH_DMALLOC
dnl
dnl The dmalloc library is an useful tool to debug memory problems in
dnl your programs, but you don't really want to compile
dnl dmalloc-support into every binary you produce, because dmalloc
dnl brings performance loss.
dnl
dnl The PETI_WITH_DMALLOC macro defines a user switch '--with-dmalloc'
dnl which can be used likes this:
dnl
dnl      ./configure --with-dmalloc[=BASE-PATH]
dnl
dnl If no BASE-PATH has been provided, "/usr/local" will be used as
dnl default.
dnl
dnl The BASE-PATH is the place where autoconf expects to find the
dnl include- and link library files of dmalloc, specifically in:
dnl
dnl      $(BASE-PATH)/include
dnl      $(BASE-PATH)/lib
dnl
dnl If dmalloc-support has been enabled, the pre-processor defines
dnl "DEBUG_DMALLOC" and "DMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK" will added to CPPFLAGS
dnl as well as the apropriate "-I" statement.
dnl
dnl Use the first define in your source codes to determine whether you
dnl have dmalloc support enabled or not. Usually something like this
dnl will suffice:
dnl
dnl      #ifdef DEBUG_DMALLOC
dnl      #  include <dmalloc.h>
dnl      #endif
dnl
dnl You will find dmalloc at <http://www.dmalloc.com/>.
